# GIF recorder

This is a `GIF` recorder for `Windows` and `Linux`. License of the code is `GPL v3`.

You should know that area in the center of the application for recording has 1px margins.

Simple things are done, I did this recorder in a few days. I want to make saving in a separate thread,
and don't block UI, but it for later.
